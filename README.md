# PDF13

Plain old PDF viewer that does only what it says it does!

I created this app because I was annoyed by other oh-so-great PDF viewer that either showed more ads than PDFs or required me to log in for reasons.
So now I have my own PDF viewer.

# Run the app on your machine

### Clone the git repository
You can clone the repository on Android Studio or whatever IDE you might use and simply run it on an Android Phone or Tablet Emulator with minSdk 16.

## Get the app from Google Play
The app is uploaded to the production track and available for download [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.renespies.pdf13).
